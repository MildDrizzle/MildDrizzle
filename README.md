### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Well, well, well, it looks like we've got a mild drizzle fan in this Github! I'm Ramos Lee, but you can call me your resident rain guru. While some people are all about that sunshine and blue skies, you know that a little bit of precipitation is what really gets you going. That soothing sound of raindrops tapping against the window, the way everything smells so fresh and clean after a good soaking, and let's not forget the perfect excuse to snuggle up with a cozy blanket and binge-watch your favorite shows. And hey, if you're lucky, you might even spot a rainbow or two! So if you're ready to ditch the sunglasses and bust out the rain jacket, let's get meeting on Skype and celebrate the joys of mild drizzle together!

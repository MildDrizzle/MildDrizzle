Well, well, well, it looks like we've got a mild drizzle fan in this Github! I'm Ramos Lee, but you can call me your resident rain guru. While some people are all about that ☀️ and blue skies, you know that a little bit of precipitation is what really gets you going.

That soothing sound of raindrops tapping against the window, the way everything smells so fresh and clean after a good soaking, and let's not forget the perfect excuse to snuggle up with a cozy blanket and binge-watch your favorite shows. And hey, if you're lucky, you might even spot a 🌈 or two! So if you're ready to ditch the sunglasses and carry ☂️, let's get meeting on Skype and celebrate the joys of mild drizzle together!
